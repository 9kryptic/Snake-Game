# Snake-Game
I built this Snake Game through the teachings of Ania Kubow, on the front-end career path of scrimba(great teacher BTW),
it includes

☻ css
☻ JavaScript
☻ HTML

for the JavaScrip side we used appendChild, addEventListener, functions, classList, and a few other to not
mention all that we did use, you can see all the code used within this project,

css was used to create some the look of the game the snake and the apple within the visible html,
ms kubow taught me how to set up a grid and how to make the grid wrap it self to fit within a border

HTML contains the basics.

on my own i added a high score board through the HTML and added some css of my own to further style the look of it all
i made the apple round, the snake also round (sort of), and used some code within JavaScript to make sure the high score persists
thourgh page refresh and, i tried to make the high score board update in real time once the score surpased the most recent high score,
but i just ran into trouble, i do look forward in to improving this nokia style snake game in the future but feel free to leave feedback
the new high score displays once you click start/restart or refresh the page.

PS. thank you so much Ania Kubow for the lesson, please feel free to istruct me further on this project and any other i upload.
